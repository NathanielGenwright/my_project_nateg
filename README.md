# DevOps Practice: Support Cases

This repo simulates real-world application support work as you level up toward DevOps.  
Use it to practice Git workflows, log parsing, scripting automation, and structured troubleshooting.

## Exercises
See `tasks.md` for guided tasks. Complete them in branches named per task (e.g., `task/parse-errors`).

## Support Scenario
You're on-call for a SaaS app. Incoming tickets include log files with mixed INFO/WARN/ERROR lines.  
Goal: Automate triage, extract key signals, and version your fixes cleanly in Git.
